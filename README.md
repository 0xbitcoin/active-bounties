      Bounty of 100 to 500 0xBTC tokens for idenification of minor to critical vulnerabilities in the smart contract

    Bounty of 500 0xBTC tokens for a detailed specification and sample implementation for a method for opening, closing, and transacting with Raiden state channels within LavaWallet

3. Desktop App for [Lava Wallet](https://github.com/admazzola/lava-wallet) 

    A bounty of 1000 0xBTC tokens for a desktop app (Electron?) which treats tokens as first class citizens and uses the LavaWallet smart contract as the backend.  This will allow for users to import their Ethereum accounts and view their Lava Wallet balance as well as their standard Account Balance for each token they own.  It will allow for deposting and withdrawing each token into and out of lava wallet.   It will allow for approving off-chain lava payments to other services/smart contracts.  It will include a 'friends list' where names can be assigned to Ethereum addresses (humans or contracts).
